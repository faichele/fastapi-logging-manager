# Domain Docs

How engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists: it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you are about to work in.

If any of these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   ├── adr/
│   │   ├── 0001-example-decision.md
│   │   └── 0002-another-decision.md
│   └── agents/
└── fastapi_logging_manager/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept (in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name), use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept needed is not in the glossary yet, either reconsider the new language or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If an output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007, but worth reopening because…_
